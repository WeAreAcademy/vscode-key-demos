# Show Call Hierarchy

### Illustrative Task

-   Find out everywhere `functionD` (declared in `d.ts`) is called,
-   ...and who calls _those_ functions, in turn,
-   ...and so on, up the chain(s).

Try to do this manually, at first.

### Solution

Navigate to d.ts, right-click on functionD and choose show call hierarchy - and observe the keyboard shortcut next to it.
(on mac, `option+shift+h`)
